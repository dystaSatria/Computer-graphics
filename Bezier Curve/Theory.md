# Bezier Curve

Bezier curve is discovered by the French engineer **Pierre BÃ©zier**. These curves can be generated under the control of other points. Approximate tangents by using control points are used to generate curve. The Bezier curve can be represented mathematically as

The Bezier Curve formula below can be used to define smooth curves between points in space using line handlers (line P0 to P1 and line P2 to P3).
```
P(t) = (1-t)^3P0 + 3(1-t)^2tP1 + 3(1-t)t^2P2 + t^3P3
```
